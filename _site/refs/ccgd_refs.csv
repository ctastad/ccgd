Heltemes-Harris 2016-01,26500062,2017-02-20,"Heltemes-Harris et al., conducted a transposon insertional mutagenesis screen in mice to identify candidate cancer genes that contribute to B-Cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Their mouse model included a weakly constitutively active Stat5b transgene, which by itself was not sufficient to induce B cell leukemia in the majority of mice. They crossed the mice to CD79a-Cre x Rosa26-LsL-SB11 x T2/Onc to induce active transposition in progenitor B cells. They analyzed 65 leukemias and identified CISs using TAPDANCE and gCIS.","Data was extracted from Table 1, Supp Table 1 and Supp Table 2 and CISs were combined. Genomic coordinates were taken from TAPDANCE for 12 CISs and from gCIS for the remaining CISs. Coordinates were updated to GrcM38/mm10 using UCSC LiftOver and official symbols were based on MGI batch query. Relative rank was based on number of tumors with insertion."
Rangel 2016-01,27849608,2017-03-13,"Rangel et al., performed an SB screen to identify drivers of triple negative breast cancer. They used conditional Pten knockout mice (Ptentm1Hwu/J) with the K5-Cre transgene along with SB11 (Rosa26-LsL-SB11) and two strains of transposon positive mice (T2/Onc2 6113, T2/Onc3 12740).  Mice developed adenocarcinomas, adenomyoepitheliomas, and adenosquamous carcinomas. Authors analyzed insertions in 34 tumors (18 from T2/Onc2 and 15 from T2/Onc3) using Gaussian Kernel Convolution and gCIS and combined into a single list.","Data was extracted from Supplemental Table 2. Official symbols and genomic coordinates for GrcM38/mm10 were extracted from MGI Batch Query. Genomic coordinates for GKC calls were based on CIS Peak location +/- half of CIS width. Coordinates were updated to GrcM38/mm10 using UCSC LiftOver. Relative Rank was based on number of tumors with insertions, using GKC values if possible, otherwise using gCIS values."
Chen 2017-01,28251929,2017-03-14,"Chen, et al., performed an SB screen to identify drivers of breast cancer. They performed the screen using both predisposed mice using a  mutant beta-catenin under control of the keratin 5 promoter (K5-N57β-cat) and wild-type mice. The SB system consisted of Rosa26-LsL-SB11  and T2/Onc and was activated by K5-Cre. They analyzed transposon insertions in 34 mammary tumors from both predisposed and non-predisposed mice. CISs were identified by gaussian kernel convolution.","Data was extracted from Dataset S2. CISs identifying the same gene were combined, while CISs identifying two genes were duplicated. CIS coordinates were converted to GRCm38/mm10 using UCSC LiftOver. Official symbols were obtained using MGI Batch Query. Relative Rank was based on GKC Approximate p-value adjusted across genome."
Chen 2016-01,27398792,2017-03-14,"Chen et al., used an organotypic recellulartization model by depleting cells from fresh normal human colon tissue and then seeding in hTERT-immortalized, but otherwise normal, human colonic epithelial cells (hCECs) along with primary myofibroblasts and endoethelial cells from healthy subjects. The SB screen was performed by stably transducing hCECs with an shRNA to APC followed by transfection with a modified version of T2/Onc2 along with SB100x. hCECs were then seeded into the model and monitored for submucosal invasion. 21 invasive neoplasis from 15 recellularized colon matrices were analyzed for SB insertions via linker-mediated PCR followed by sequencing. Insertion sites with the deepest read counts (top 10%) were considered clonal and were considered to identify candidate cancer genes.","Data was extracted from supplemental Table 2. Mouse homologs and GRCm38/mm10 genomic coordinates were identified using MGI Batch Query. Relative rank was assigned based on number of invasive neoplasias with insertions (1 = B, more than 1 = A). Unlike the majority of screens in this database, this was done using human cells and candidate genes were not identified by an anlysis of CISs."
Suarez-Cabrera 2017-01,28108518,2017-03-14,"Suarez-Cabrera, et al., performed an SB screen in mice to identify drivers of breast cancer on a heterozygous conditional p53 background (Trp53F2-10). The SB system consisted of T2/Onc2 and a K5-SB11 transgene. The heterozygous p53 allele was generated using a K5-Cre transgene.  Transposon insertions were analyzed in 33 mammary gland tumors from 26 mice. The majority of tumors were classified as acinar carcionma or adenocarcinoma with fewer papillary carcinoma or cystadenocarcinoma. The majority of tumors were ER positive. CISs were identified by gCIS and had to present in at least three separate tumors.",Data was taken from Table 1. Gene symbols and gneomic coordinates for GRCm38/mm10 were obtained using MGI Batch Query. Relative Rank was based on number of tumors in each CIS.
Xu 2017-01,28062688,2017-03-13,"Xu, et al., performed a screen for liver cancer drivers by delivering a library of CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs using a Piggybac transposon. They used the GeCKOv2 library targeting all mouse protein coding genes and microRNAs. They targeted the liver by using high pressure tail vein injections. Mice were sensitized to liver cancer by co-delivering PB transposons containing sgRNA to Cdkn2a and a mutated RAS (hNRASG12V). All mice were euthanized at 45 days and the majority of tumors were Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. 18 tumors from 8 mice were analyzed by deep sequencing for presence of sgRNAs. If an sgRNA sequence was detected at a high read count, the targeted gene was considered a candidate cancer tumor suppressor gene.",Data was extracted from Dataset 1. Official gene symbols and genomic coordinates for GRCm38/mm10 were obtained using MGI batch query. No relative rank was assigned due to the vast majority of sgRNAs being identified in only a single tumor.
Wu 2016-01,26904939,2017-03-14,"Wu, et al., performed an SB screen to identify genes driving development of neurofibromas. Their model used a desert hedgehog Cre (Dhh-Cre) to initiate transposition and loss of NF1 (NF1fl/fl) in Schwann cells. The SB system consisted of  Rosa26-LsL-SB11 and T2/Onc transposons. Insertion sites from 49 neurofibromas were analyzed using Monte Carlo criteria for statistical significance.",Data was extracted from Figure 1A. Official symbols and genomic coordinates from GRCm38/mm10 were obtained from MGI batch query. Relative rank was based on number of Neurofibromas with an insertion. CIS coordinates were not published.
