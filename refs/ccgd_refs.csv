Berquam Vrieze 2011-01,21828136,2013-07-22,"Berquam-Vrieze et al. investigated the cell-of-origin in a mouse model of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by conducting Sleeping Beauty screens at various time points within the T-cell lineage. One of three different Cre transgenes activated RosaSBase-LSL, driving T2/Onc2 transposon integration in either HSCs (Vav-iCre), immature thymocytes lacking CD4/CD8 expression (Lck-Cre), or late-stage CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes (CD4-Cre). Screen 01 corresponds to insertions in Vav-iCre cells. All animals reaching 20 weeks of age in this cohort were euthanized. Genomic DNA used for analysis was extracted at the time of necropsy from thymic lymphomas. ",All data were gathered from Supplementary Table 3. Start and End coordinates were originally reported using NCBI37 build. They were converted to GRCm38/mm10 using UCSC LiftOver. Predicted effect information was included in Table S3.

Berquam Vrieze 2011-03,21828136,2013-07-22,"Berquam-Vrieze et al. investigated the cell of origin in a mouse model of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by conducting Sleeping Beauty screens at various time points within the T-cell lineage.

Screen 03 corresponds to insertions in CD4-Cre cells. Genomic DNA used for analysis was extracted at the time of necropsy from thymic lymphomas. ","All data were gathered from Supplementary Table 3. Start and End coordinates were originally reported using NCBI37 build. They were converted to GRCm38/mm10 using UCSC LiftOver. Three separate screens were conducted using HSCs (Vav-iCre), immature thymocytes (Lck-Cre), or late-stage CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes (CD4-Cre). Screen 03 corresponds to insertions in CD4-Cre cells. Predicted effect information was included in Table S3."
Mann 2012-01,22421440,2013-07-22,"Mann et al. identified mutations cooperating with oncogenic Kras in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. An oncogenic LSL-KrasG12D allele expressed specifically in the pancreas by a Pdx1-Cre driver was used in combination with T2/Onc2 and T3/Onc3 transgenic lines, in which Cre recombinase induced transposition via the Rosa26-LSL-SB11 cassette. Tumors were extracted and sequenced at necropsy from variable cohorts of mice and common insertion sites determined. ","All data were gathered from Supplementary Table 1. Peak locations were listed for each CIS. This singular location was used as both the Start and End value. Coordinates were originally reported using NCBI37 build. They were converted to GRCm38/mm10 using UCSC LiftOver. Predicted mutagenic consequences of insertion, listed in Table S1, are categorized as activation and disruption which are coded in the CCGD as Gain or Loss, respectively. "
Collier 2009-01,19843846,2013-07-22,"By generating mice with different transposon/transposase combinations, Collier et al. assessed the efficacy of Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis to accurately pinpoint candidate cancer drivers. Crossing T2/onc low-copy number lines with Rosa26-SB11 enabled the authors to successfully drive tumorigenesis in mice while avoiding the confounding problems of embryonic lethality and genomic instability. CIS analysis was performed after cloning insertions from 59 of the resulting leukemias/lymphomas and subtracting insertions located on the donor concatomer chromosome. ","All data were gathered from Table 2. Start and End coordinates were originally reported using NCBI36 build. They were converted to GRCm38/mm10 using UCSC LiftOver. No predicted effect information was included in the data. Tumors were variable (lymphomas, leukemia, sarcoma, glioma).  "
Rahrmann 2009-01,19401450,2013-07-22,"Rahrmann et al. investigated the candidate cancer genes driving prostate cancer using a Sleeping Beauty screen in mice. Utilizing Rosa26-SB11;T2/onc transgenic mice in both wildtype and Arf-/- backgrounds, the authors identified proliferation clusters in the prostatic epithelium. These clusters were laser captured and analyzed using linker-mediated PCR followed by sequencing. ","All data were gathered from Supplementary Table 1. Start and End coordinates were originally reported using NCBI37 build. They were converted to GRCm38/mm10 using UCSC LiftOver. Gene-centric analysis was performed by the authors, so the Start and End coordinates correspond to the start and end locations of the gene containing the insertions. No predicted effect information was included in the data. "
Koudijis 2011-01,21852388,2013-07-22,"Koudijis et al. tested a new method for analyzing transposon mutagenesis insertion sites, termed shear-splink. The authorsâ€™ claim was that by shearing genomic DNA into random fragments, shear-splink eliminated the bias associated with PCR amplification of fragments generated using restriction enzymes. A panel of 127 Sleeping Beauty-induced lymphomas was used for the methods comparison. ","All data were gathered from Supplementary Table 6. Start and End coordinates were originally reported using NCBI37 build. They were converted to GRCm38/mm10 using UCSC LiftOver. Multiple restriction enzymes were used for mutagenic analysis, but the data was averaged into a single CCGD screen, which identified CISs based on NlaIII and BfaI-based RE-splink and the new analytic method, shear-splink. No predicted effect information was included in the data. "
Quintana 2012-01,22832494,2013-07-22,"Quintana et al. performed a Sleeping Beauty screen in mouse skin to identify the genes implicated in nonmelanoma skin cancer etiology. The bovine keratin K5 promoter was used to drive SB11 transposase expression, which activated T2/Onc2 transposition specifically in the epidermal stem cells. Two mouse lines harboring the T2/Onc2 transposon in different chromosomal locations were used in the study. High-throughput sequencing of the genomic DNA obtained from the resulting tumors revealed common insertion sites. ",All data were gathered from Supplementary Table S2. The number of tumors corresponds to relative strength used in CCGD. Start and End coordinates were originally reported using NCBI37 build. They were converted to GRCm38/mm10 using UCSC LiftOver.  Gene-centric analysis identified CIS regions. The Start and End coordinates correspond to the start and end locations of the gene containing the insertions. No predicted effect information was included in the data.
